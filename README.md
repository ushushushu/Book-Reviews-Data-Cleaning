## Goodreads book reviews: A data cleaning project
A data cleaning project on Goodreads book reviews using PostgreSQL, while pandas was used in converting csv files to Excel files.

The files within this repository are incomplete, since the other files are too large for GitHub. This repository contains only the SQL files used for data cleaning. If you wish to see the query results using my script, kindly run the "works_data cleaning.sql" file first before the "reviews_data cleaning.sql" file. 

If you wish to see the complete files, kindly refer to this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-eqgJlbMkbzl9Opgig90a5mbysJw48hW?usp=sharing
